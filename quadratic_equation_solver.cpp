/*
Write	a	program	that	does	the	following:
â€¢ Ask	user	to	input	three	Real numbers	a,	b	and	c.	They	represent	the	parameters	of	a	
quadratic	equation.
You should identify and see if the given equation has the following: 
    1. Infinite number of solutions
    2. No solution
    3. No real solution
    4. One real solution
    5. Two real solutions

If there are 1 or 2 real solutions, also print the solutions.
